# GitPaste
GitPaste is a `GitHub Gist` clone.


## Quick Introduction

This is an alternative to gist.github.com. It allows you to deploy and create your own gist.github.com-like application. It is useful in an environment where you may not be able to use gist.github.com or alternatives.


## More Detailed Reasoning

> Why would company policies that ban github permit your alternative?

It's not a matter of being able to use github--there's no problem with it. There's an issue with posting code that does not have such permissible license. We're just simply not allowed to for a lot of the work. Sure, we could use private accounts, but we would still be violating the policy in a more devious manner. This allows anyone to deploy a gist.github-like setup on their local server where it can be isolated if needed.


## Dependencies

There's a requirements.txt. If you use pip then just continue reading.

# Database

GitPaste comes configured to use a Postgres database out of the box. The parameters
for the database are stored in `saic/config.py` - if you don't want to use Postgres,
an option is available to use SQLite instead, also in `config.py`.

If you wish to do this, you should remove the `psycopg2` line from `requirements.txt` 
**BEFORE** running the install command below.
    

# Building
*Optional*: If you have virtualenv then create your desired environment.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd saic
    python manage.py syncdb


# Running
Modify runserver.sh to fit your IP address needs.

    cd saic
    ./runserver.sh
